				ScholarSphere is committed to a transparent anti-double-dipping revenue-neutral policy.
			</p>

			<p class="w-50 text-justify mb-2">
				"Double-dipping" refers to a practice of increasing net revenue by charging and retaining OA fees for
				the
				same content that is being paid for by subscription.
			</p>

			<p class="w-50 text-justify mb-2">
				ScholarSphere does not follow this practice.
			</p>

			<p class="w-50 text-justify mb-2">
				Until such time as the uptake on author-choice hybrid OA reaches a tipping point that starts to reduce
				subscriptions, ScholarSphere will rebate or provide credits on a going forward basis 100% of the net
				revenue generated from its Hybrid Open Access publishing program.
			</p>

			<p class="w-50 text-justify mb-2">
				ScholarSphere has launched a number of new Gold Open Access journals and while utilizing a portion of
				its growing
				Hybrid Open Access Fund to underwrite or subsidize the cost of APCs during each Gold OA journals'
				initial
				years of publication.
			</p>

			<p class="w-50 text-justify mb-2">
				ScholarSphere is committed to providing authors of all ScholarSphere publications with an option to make
				the published versions
				of their works freely available to the general public via the ScholarSphere Digital Library.
			</p>

			<p class="w-50 text-justify mb-2">
				Authors wishing to take advantage of this option may do so by paying an Open Access fee to ScholarSphere
				prior to
				publication. Authors who just want to publish their articles for access by ScholarSphere's large
				subscription base may
				do so without paying any fees.
			</p>

			<p class="w-50 text-justify mb-2">
				The Open Access fee option to publish in established subscription-based publications is commonly
				referred to
				as the Hybrid Open Access Model.
			</p>

			<p class="w-50 text-justify mb-2">
				The Hybrid Open Access Model has existed for a number of years, though different publishers and
				societies
				choose to implement it in different ways. Many feel that Hybrid Open Access options are a step in the
				right
				direction in making the scholarly literature more openly accessible. But there is also concern that some
				publishers may unfairly take advantage of such a model for their own financial gain by using open access
				fees to supplement their existing subscription revenue streams, rather than use them responsibly to
				address
				the growing concern over funding in the library environment.
			</p>

			<p class="w-50 text-justify mb-2">
				The practice of enhancing net revenues by retaining OA fees for content that is also paid for by
				subscription has been dubbed "double-dipping".
			</p>

			<p class="w-50 text-justify mb-2">
				In developing ScholarSphere's Hybrid Open Access model, much consideration was given to concerns raised
				about this
				perceived "double-dipping" by some publishers.
			</p>

			<p class="w-50 text-justify mb-2">
				As one of the world's leading scientific societies, ScholarSphere is committed to publishing policies
				that advance the
				goals of scientific discovery, innovation, and education in a sustainable and responsible way.
				ScholarSphere's Hybrid
				Open Access Program is therefore being implemented in a highly transparent, affordable, and fair way for
				the
				mutual benefit of all stakeholders in the scholarly community.
			</p>

			<p class="w-50 text-justify mb-2">
				Therefore, until such time that the author uptake on Hybrid Open Access may reach a tipping point
				leading to
				cancellation of subscriptions and reduction of revenue, ScholarSphere will allocate 100% of the net
				revenue received
				from OA fees either towards Gold and Hybrid OA programs, or towards credit for renewing academic
				libraries
				(See ScholarSphere's Hybrid OA Revenue Policy).
			</p>

			<p class="w-50 text-justify mb-2">
				ScholarSphere's subscription revenue has not been reduced thus far and it is not expected that it will
				be reduced by
				its Open Access program for some time to come. This is in large part due to the fact that ScholarSphere
				is and has
				been one of the most affordable publishers in terms of content value and subscription prices.
			</p>

			<p class="w-50 text-justify mb-2">
				For authors, this means that OA fees are kept to a minimum and sustainable level, as well as the option
				to
				take advantage of significant discounts by becoming an ScholarSphere member.
			</p>

			<p class="w-50 text-justify mb-2">
				For libraries, ScholarSphere is committed to rebating and/or crediting, and / or crediting on a global
				basis 100% of
				the net returning revenue ScholarSphere generates from its Hybrid Open Access program and this revenue
				to the library
				community, or allocating this revenue towards the subsidizing of OA programs.
			</p>

			<p class="w-50 text-justify mb-2">
				For users of the ScholarSphere Digital Library and consumers of ScholarSphere's publications this means
				that more of the
				scholarly literature from ScholarSphere's high quality and impact publications is available to a wider
				potential
				audience of readers.
			</p>

			<p class="w-50 text-justify mb-2">
				For Funding Agencies and Institutional OA Funds, this means that they can trust that investigators who
				are
				recipients of their research funds will be utilizing those funds to publish in a responsible way that
				keeps
				these funds in the research community.

				ScholarSphere Policy Regarding Merging Academic Institutions
			</h4>

			<p class="w-50 text-justify mb-2">
				In recent years, there has also been a growing trend among academic consortia where existing
				institutional
				Digital Library subscribers have merged with other subscribing institutions belonging to the same
				consortium. This has made it necessary for ScholarSphere to reevaluate its pricing policies to make
				certain these
				merging institutions are priced in a manner consistent with ScholarSpheres general fee criteria while
				still providing
				access to ScholarSpheres high quality scholarly research content at an affordable rate.
			</p>

			<p class="w-50 text-justify mb-2">
				In the event an existing subscribing institution merges with another institution that does not subscribe
				to
				the Digital Library, the current yearâ€™s pricing for the existing subscriber shall remain in effect for
				the
				remainder of the active subscription period. Upon renewal, the DL subscription tier and fees shall be
				based
				on the reported full-text downloads (or usage) of the prior subscribing institution and the combined
				total
				FTE and number of research staff and faculty of the newly merged institution.
			</p>

			<p class="w-50 text-justify mb-2">
				In the event two existing institutions within a consortium that both subscribe to the DL merge into one
				institution, ScholarSphere will maintain
				the separate and applicable Digital Library renewal fee for each member in year one of the merger. After
